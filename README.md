## About

Chordisto reads an input of chord symbols entered as a string, breaks the string into individual chords,
before further parsing each chord into root note and triad type.

It then feeds back byte values for each note in the given triad into a midi library which provides playback.

It is designed to be useful for musicians practising solo.

Chordisto is written in Java and runs on the Android mobile platform.

Chordisto was implemented as a Java/Android project over the course of one week.
